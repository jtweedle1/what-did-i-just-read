# What Did I Just Read? – AI-Powered Reader's Assistant

A learning tool designed for diverse students and learners who struggle with dense, traditional reading. This project uses LLMs and other generative AI tools to instantly reframe complex text into more digestible formats, like casual summaries, diagrams, audio narration, and mini-quizzes.

## Project Goals

- Help users **retain and understand** complex information better
- Support **visual, auditory, and interactive learning styles**
- Create an ADHD-friendly tool with **low friction** and **instant feedback**

## Example Input & Output

**Input:** "In classical conditioning, a neutral stimulus paired with an unconditioned stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus that elicits a response."

**Outputs:**
- **Summary:** When you hear the ice cream truck song and start drooling - yep, that’s conditioning.
- **Visual Map:** [Neutral Stimulus] + [UCS] → [CS] → [Response]
- **Audio Clip:** Plays ~30 sec version of the summary
- **Quiz:** What does a neutral stimulus become? → Conditioned Stimulus ✅
